# Detect Interference on GNSS Signals
This project is my solution to UltraHack: Galileo Innovation Challenge. Link to
the event: https://ultrahack.org/galileoinnovationchallenge.

# Project Topic
While navigating using satellite positioning systems, oneâ€™s location might be
affected by signal interference. There are natural and manmade causes to this.
In order to block signal interference, are you able to identify it from the right
signal?
